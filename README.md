# PDF Page Range Extractor

A simple, client-side web application that extracts specific page ranges from PDF files. All processing happens in your browser - your files never leave your device.

## Features

- Extract any page range from a PDF (e.g., pages 2-5 from a 100-page document)
- Drag & drop or click to upload
- Fully client-side - no server uploads required
- Clean, modern interface
- Mobile responsive

## How to Use

1. Upload a PDF file by clicking the upload area or dragging and dropping
2. Enter the start and end page numbers (inclusive)
3. Click "Extract Pages" to download your new PDF

For example, if you have a 100-page PDF and enter start: 2, end: 5, you'll get a 4-page PDF containing pages 2, 3, 4, and 5.
